## Project Vivlio
Project Vivlio is a project developed by two UC Berkeley students, James Hong and Max Buchan, during the Fall 2017 semester. The projectâ€™s goal is to provide free access to textbooks by offering non-monetary incentives to professors to encourage their participation.


### Getting Started
Simply, go to http://berkeleytext.org to start browsing through the collection of texts. For access rights, please send an email to either James Hong at jhhong@berkeley.edu or Max Buchan at maxbuchan@berkeley.edu. 

To report bugs in berkeleytext.com please either email James or Max.
