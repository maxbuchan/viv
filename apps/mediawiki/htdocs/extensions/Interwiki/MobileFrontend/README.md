MobileFrontend Extension
========================

The MobileFrontend extension adds a mobile view to your mediawiki instance.

Installation
------------

See <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Installation>

Development
-----------

### Coding conventions

Please follow the coding conventions of MobileFrontend:
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MobileFrontend/Coding_conventions>

#### Git hooks

Git hooks are provided in the dev-scripts directory to assist with adhering to
JavaScript code standards, optimizing PNG files, etc. Running these hooks
requires node.js, NPM, and grunt.

Install like so:

    make installhooks

If you are not running Vagrant, be sure to set your `MEDIAWIKI_URL` env
variable to your local index path, e.g.
`MEDIAWIKI_URL=http://localhost/index.php/`

### Committing

Commits are important as they give the reviewer more information to
successfully review your code and find errors or potential problems you might
not have thought of.

Commits are also useful when troubleshooting issues and refactoring. If it's
not clear why a line of code is in the repository important bug fixes could be
lost.

Commits should be as minor as possible. Please avoid removing unrelated
console.log statements, fixing unrelated whitespace etc. do that in a separate
commit which mentions the word cleanup.

First line commit should summarise the commit with bug it fixes if applicable.
e.g. *Fix problem with toggling see bug x*.

Second line should be blank. Third line should go into detail where necessary
providing links to blog posts/other bugs to provide more background. Mention
the platforms/browsers the change is for where necessary, e.g.:

* *This is a problem on Android but not OSX, see `http://<url></url>` which
  explains problem in detail*
* *This is a workaround for a known bug in opera mobile see
  `http://<url></url>`*

### Testing

#### Unit tests

To run the full test suite run:

    make tests

To run only PHP tests:

    make phpunit

To run only JS tests:

    make qunit

#### Selenium tests

For information on how to run Selenium tests please see README file in
tests/browser directory.

### Releasing

A new version of MobileFrontend is released every two weeks following the
Wikimedia release train if there are new changes.

MobileFrontend follows the version naming from MediaWiki.

Configuration options

#### $wgMFEditorOptions

Options to control several functions of the mobile editor.  Possible values:

  Whether or not anonymous (not logged in) users should be able to edit.  Note
  this is highly experimental and comes without any warranty and may introduce
  bugs until anonymous editing experience is addressed in this extension.
  Anonymous editing on mobile is still a big unknown. See bug 53069.  Thoughts
  welcomed on
  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mobile_wikitext_editing#Anonymous_editing>
* `skipPreview`: Should the mobile edit workflow contain an edit preview
  (before save) to give the user the possibility to review the new text
  resulting of his changes or not.

  [
    'anonymousEditing' => true,
    'skipPreview' => false,

* Default: `64 * 1024`

#### $wgMFAutodetectMobileView

Set this to true to automatically show mobile view depending on people's
user-agent.

appropriately, to avoid people receiving cached versions of pages intended for
someone else's devices.*

* Type: `Boolean`
* Default: `false`

#### $wgMFVaryOnUA

Set this to `true`, if you want to send `User-Agent` in the `Vary` header. This
could improve your SEO ranking.

*WARNING: You should set this to true only, if you know what you're doing!*

*CAUTION: Setting this to true in combination with a (frontend)caching layer
(such as Varnish) can have a huge impact on how your caching works, as it now
caches every single page multiple times for any possible/different User Agent
string!*

* Type: `Boolean`
* Default: `false`

#### $wgMFShowMobileViewToTablets

Controls whether tablets should be shown the mobile site. Works only if
`$wgMFAutodetectMobileView` is `true`.

adapted for improved reading on small screens.

a tablet/desktop.

* Type: `Integer`

#### $wgMobileUrlTemplate

Template for mobile URLs.

This will be used to transcode regular URLs into mobile URLs for the mobile
view.

It's possible to specify the *mobileness* of the URL in the host portion of the
URL.

You can either statically or dynamically create the host-portion of your mobile
URL. To statically create it, just set `$wgMobileUrlTemplate` to the static
hostname. For example:

```php
$wgMobileUrlTemplate = "mobile.mydomain.com";
```

Alternatively, the host definition can include placeholders for different parts
of the *host* section of a URL. The placeholders are denoted by `%h` and
followed with a digit that maps to the position of a host-part of the original,
non-mobile URL. Take the host `en.wikipedia.org` for example.  `%h0` maps to
`en`, `%h1` maps to `wikipedia`, and `%h2` maps to `org`.  So, if you wanted
a mobile URL scheme that turned `en.wikipedia.org` into `en.m.wikipedia.org`,
your URL template would look like:

    %h0.m.%h1.%h2

* Type: `String`
* Default: `''`

#### $wgMobileFrontendFormatCookieExpiry

The number of seconds the `useformat` cookie should be valid.

The useformat cookie gets set when a user manually elects to view either the
mobile or desktop view of the site.

If this value is not set, it will default to `$wgCookieExpiration`

* Type: `Integer|null`
* Default: `null`

#### $wgMFNoindexPages

Set to false to allow search engines to index your mobile pages. So far, Google
seems to mix mobile and non-mobile pages in its search results, creating
confusion.

* Type: `Boolean`
* Default: `true`

#### $wgMFStopRedirectCookieHost

Set the domain of the `stopMobileRedirect` cookie.

If this value is not set, it will default to the top domain of the host name
(e.g. `en.wikipedia.org = .wikipedia.org`)

If you want to set this to a top domain (to cover all subdomains), be sure to
include the preceding `.` (e.g. yes: `.wikipedia.org`, **no**: `wikipedia.org`)

* Type: `String|null`
* Default: `null`

#### $wgMFCustomLogos

Make the logos configurable.

Currently, `copyright`, `copyright-width`, and `copyright-height` elements are
supported.

* `copyright` is the URL of the logo displayed in the header and footer
* `copyright-width` (optional) is the width in pixels of the copyright image
  you want to display
* `copyright-height` (optional) is the height in pixels of the copyright image
  you want to display
* If the actual `copyright` dimensions are 200x30, then you may want to set the
  width and height to 100 and 15 respectively (in order to support retina
  screens).
* Note that if -width and -height are not used sysadmin should ensure the image
used is appropriately sized (suggested dimensions < 120px width and 18px height).

Example:
```php
[
  'copyright' => '/images/mysite_copyright_logo.png',
  'copyright-width' => 100,
  'copyright-height' => 15,
]
```

* Type: `Array`
* Default: `[]`

* Default: `false`

#### $wgMFTrademarkSitename

Whether to append a trademark notice to the sitename in the page footer.

* If set to `true` or `'unregistered'`, adds a ™ to the sitename.
* If set to `'registered'` adds a ® to the sitename.
* If set to `false`, adds nothing (the default).

Alternatively, you can also edit the `mobile-frontend-footer-sitename`
message directly.

* Type: `Boolean`
* Default: `false`

#### $wgMFEnableBeta

Whether beta mode is enabled.

* Type: `Boolean`

* Type: `Array`
* Default:
```php
  [
    // Authorship and licensing information should be visible initially
    NS_FILE,
    // Otherwise category contents will be hidden
    NS_CATEGORY,
    // Don't collapse various forms
    NS_SPECIAL,
    // Just don't
    NS_MEDIA,
  ]
```

  [
    "image/svg+xml",
  ]
```
